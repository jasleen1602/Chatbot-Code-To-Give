Virtualenv is a tool to set up your Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. You can install venv to your host Python by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
  pip install virtualenv
```

To use venv in your project, in your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
  python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
```

Now that you have created the virtual environment, you will need to activate it before you can use it in your project. On Windows, to activate your virtual environment, run the code below:

```bash
  <virtual-environment-name>/Scripts/activate
```

Install the above dependencies

```bash
  pip install
```

For training the model, run the following command:

```bash
  python Bot/train.py
```

Run the following commands to start the application on your local host

```bash
  python main.py
```

Stop the app from terminal:

```bash
    Ctrl+C
